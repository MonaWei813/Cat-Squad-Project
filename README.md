# Cat-Squad-Project
Cat Squad is the team name we use when doing uni projects. 
This team includes two gals: Silvia and me. 
We know our completed projects are not-so-perfect. 
But we are learners and  keeping our heads immersed in the ocean of knowledge.

### If the project cannot be built or run.....
Please email me, let me know, I might fix it for you.....
